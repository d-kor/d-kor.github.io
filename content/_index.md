## About Me 

Hi! I am a fourth-​year PhD student in Computer Science at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) as a member of the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/). I am supervised by [Prof. Dr. Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/) and co-​supervised by [Prof. Dr. Timothy Roscoe](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/troscoe/).

I work mostly at the intersection between software and hardware. My main research area is on creating novel abstractions for modern heterogeneous architectures. I usually spend most of my time hacking away in the fields of computer architecture, operating systems and networking (mostly *RDMA*). I am also interested in recent compiler advancements (MLIR) and their usage for these novel computing systems.

Research interests:

* Computer Architecture
* Operating Systems
* Networking
* Data Management
* Compilers

## Education

## Experience

During my studies I have interned at the following companies:

* [:small_red_triangle: **Hewlett Packard Enterprise**](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html), California USA <br />
I worked on the open-source distributed object storage (*DAOS*). During the internship I explored novel system architectures and advantages of closely coupled server side operations utilizing heterogeneous hardware.

* [:small_red_triangle: **Microsoft Research**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), Cambridge UK <br />
I worked on the *Honeycomb* project. The ultimate goal of the project was the creation of an RDMA, CPU-free distributed storage. I explored memory subsystem architectures for common B-tree abstractions.

* [:small_red_triangle: **ABB Research**](https://global.abb/group/en/technology/corporate-research-centers), Baden Switzerland <br />
Investigation and development of security concepts and algorithms for embedded system devices. Implemented a SoC design of a proposed novel encryption scheme.
